# google-cloud-shell-dotfiles
Intended to share helpful .bash files for use with Google Cloud's Cloud Shell to improve user experience

the "dot" files refers to files such as .bashrc and .bash_aliases that are located in the /home/<user> directory, often referred to by the "~" character.  In your home user directory, you can add the .bash_aliases file which will be used to maintain all of your aliases.  The .bashrc file is already configured to recognize this file upon login.
  
  You can check current aliases by issuing the 'alias' command.  There are other useful aliases already created such as 'll' which quickly does a 'long list' of the current directory.
